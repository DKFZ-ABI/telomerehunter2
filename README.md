# TelomereHunter2 (TH2)

**‚ö†Ô∏è BETA VERSION - We welcome contributions and feedback!**

TelomereHunter2 is a complete reimplementation of the established TelomereHunter software, providing a sustainable framework for telomere analysis from whole genome sequencing data.

## About TelomereHunter

The original TelomereHunter software has been a key bioinformatics tool for digital diagnosis of telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM) in precision oncology programs including MASTER and INFORM. It has been validated through comprehensive PCAWG studies and is actively used in clinical practice and neuroblastoma research.
